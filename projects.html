            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>These are all the projects I've worked on that go into my portfolio. Each of these will explain its purpose, how its hosted, what language it was written in, and other nerdy stuff.</p>

            <h2>PulseRoot</h2>
            <h5>Secure, fast, reliable web chat for the modern internet</h5>
            <p>While PulseRoot's development is currently on hold, it doesn't stop it from being what it's meant to be: a web chat application that focuses on user security and privacy. No data is shared anywhere, passwords are hashed, and more.</p>
            <p>PulseRoot is hosted at <a href="https://pulseroot.ga/">https://pulseroot.ga/</a>, and is hosted on <a href="https://www.glitch.com/" target="_blank">Glitch</a>. It is written in NodeJS and uses the Express webserver framework.</p>
            <p>PulseRoot is also free. All features of it are planned to be free, for now. If needed, PulseRoot may have a paid membership that adds some aesthetic changes. That'll only be for users who want to help pay for PulseRoot, though. So no main features will be locked out, ever.</p>

            <h2>Spark</h2>
            <h5>Share your music. Share your world.</h5>
            <p>Spark was the first desktop application I began working on. It is being actively developed, and is nearing ready for release. I hope to have a stable version out to the public before 2020. While Spark isn't available for download yet, <a href="https://sparkapp.tk/">its site is up</a>.</p>
            <p>Spark was also created with NodeJS, but this time with the Electron framework for the app, and Express for the backend. Spark is planned to release on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Possibly even Android in the future.</p>

            <h2>Timewarp</h2>
            <h5>Unofficial TWRP Desktop Application</h5>
            <p>Timewarp is the latest application. Unlike PulseRoot and Spark, it is not being developed under Diamond Grid. It is a personal project. Timewarp is meant to be a desktop application for the custom Android recovery, TWRP (Team Win Recovery Project). If you'd like to know more about TWRP, <a href="https://twrp.me/about/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
            <p>While Timewarp is also built upon Electron, it has no backend. Therefore, no need for Express. It also utilizes <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb" target="_blank">ADB</a> as its main source of function. Because of this, it uses command line tools a lot.</p>
            <p>Despite this, it is still very cross platform. Timewarp is set to release on Windows, Mac, and Linux. With a CLI-only counterpart planned for Linux as well.</p>
