            <h3>Autumn Rivers</h3>
            <p>Hey there! My name is Autumn. I'm a 17 year old transgirl who does a lot of programming. I mainly program in JavaScript and Node.JS. However, I am learning other languages such as C# and Swift. As of now, I've made 3 professional projects in total. 2 under my small dev group, Diamond Grid, and 1 as an independent dev.</p>
            <p>Technically, since I'm the only person in Diamond Grid so far, all the projects have been individual. If you're interested in joining Diamond Grid, <a href="https://forms.gle/9jsL8df5zNUZWZdK8">come sign up</a>!</p>

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <p>I have made the following projects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.github.com/diamondgrid/pulseroot-web">PulseRoot</a></li>
                <li>Spark (Closed source until first stable release)</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.github.com/SmartieCodes/timewarp">Timewarp</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of these projects - along with this site - go into a personal portfolio that will hopefully help me get accepted into some good colleges. If you'd like to help support me with these, you can give them a star on GitHub. Or if you want to help me upgrade my servers or just help pay for development in general, <a href="https://www.ko-fi.com/autumnrivers">buy me a ko-fi</a>! Every little bit helps.</p>
            <p>For more info on each of these projects, visit their GitHub repos, or visit my <a href="./projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>
